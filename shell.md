# ls | grep searched_item

The terminal command "ls | grep testkey" consists of two separate commands connected using the "pipe" operator "|".

The first command is "ls", which stands for "list directory contents". When this command is executed, it lists all the files and directories in the current working directory.

The second command is "grep", which stands for "global regular expression print". It searches for a specific pattern or regular expression in the input and prints out any lines that contain that pattern. In this case, the pattern it is searching for is "testkey".

When the two commands are connected with the pipe operator "|", it means that the output of the first command ("ls") is fed as input into the second command ("grep"). Therefore, the overall effect of the command "ls | grep testkey" is to list all the files and directories in the current working directory, and then search through that list for any entries that contain the string "testkey". The resulting output will be a list of any files or directories that match that pattern.
