### `git init` 

Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a new .git subdirectory that contains all the necessary files for Git to track changes in your project.

### `git add` 

Adds files to the staging area. Files in the staging area are not yet committed but are ready to be committed. You can add files individually (`git add <filename>`) or add all files in the current directory (`git add .`).

### `git commit` 

Commits the changes in the staging area to the repository. Each commit should have a descriptive message that summarizes the changes made.

### `git status` 

Shows the current status of the repository, including any changes that have been made, files that have been added to the staging area, and files that have been modified but not yet staged.

### `git push` 

Uploads local changes to a remote repository. This command requires write access to the remote repository and is typically used to push changes to a shared repository on GitHub or another hosting service.

### `git pull` 

Downloads changes from a remote repository and merges them with the local repository. This command is typically used to update the local repository with changes made by others.

### `git branch` 

Shows a list of branches in the repository. You can create a new branch (`git branch <branchname>`) or switch to an existing branch (`git checkout <branchname>`).

### `git merge` 

Merges changes from one branch into another branch. This command is typically used to integrate changes from a feature branch into the main branch of the repository.

### `git clone` 

Downloads a copy of a remote repository to your local machine. This command is used to create a local copy of a shared repository so that you can work on it locally.

### `git log` 

Shows a log of all the commits in the repository. This command is used to view the history of changes made to the repository, including who made the changes and when they were made.
